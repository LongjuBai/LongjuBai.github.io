Hi! I'm a research assistant at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I'm advised by [Prof. Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/). I'm also very fortunate to be working with [Prof. Oana Ignat (Santa Clara University)](https://oanaignat.github.io/) and [Prof. Huan Sun (Ohio State University)](https://u.osu.edu/ihudas/people/). I couldn’t appreciate their invaluable insights and guidance more!​

Previously, I received my master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, with a specialization in Signal and Image Processing and the Machine Learning track.

My research interests lies broadly in `NLP (Natural Language Processing)` and `Multimodal AI`, with an aim of creating trustworthy and responsible intelligence systems - improving AI's `fairness, robustness and controlability`, and `preventing AI from being W.E.I.R.D.` (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic), (check out our recent survey paper on [why AI is W.E.I.R.D. and shouldn't be this way](https://longjubai.github.io/))

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
