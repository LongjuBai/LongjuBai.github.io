### Introduction to Representation Engineering (RepE)

Representation Engineering (RepE) offers a complementary research paradigm for understanding and controlling Large Language Models (LLMs), running parallel to Mechanistic Interpretability (MI). While **MI** primarily operates at the level of circuits—such as attention heads, pathways, and neurons—**RepE** focuses on the **representational spaces** (the inner activations at each layer). Both approaches aim to increase the transparency and control of LLM behavior.

Some potential applications of Representation Engineering include:
- **Jailbreaking**: Identifying and controlling prompts that bypass model restrictions.
- **Motion Forecasting**: Predicting movement patterns based on representation spaces.

### Structure of the RepE Paper

The RepE paper is divided into two primary sections: **Representation Reading** and **Representation Control**.

---

### Part 1: Representation Reading

**Representation Reading** aims to identify a **reading vector** in the activation space that aligns with a specific high-level concept, behavior, or function. This vector, also known as a **concept vector**, helps detect or control certain concepts within the model’s internal representation. Below are the key steps to derive this vector:

1. **Design Contrastive Inputs**: 
   Create inputs that stimulate the model’s inner activity regarding specific concepts, often using pairwise contrasts (e.g., harmful vs. harmless, honest vs. dishonest).

2. **Feed Inputs and Collect Activations**:
   Pass the designed inputs into the model and collect activations (representations) from specific layers (often from the last token's representation).

3. **Apply Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering**:
   Use techniques like **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**, **K-Means**, or other supervised or unsupervised methods to find a linear vector that effectively separates the two contrasting classes (e.g., harmful vs. harmless).

#### Usage of the Reading Vector

To make predictions, compute the **dot product** between the concept vector and a target representation vector. This indicates whether the target vector contains the concept. Alternatively, you can scan activations across all layers to assess the strength of a specific concept throughout the model.

### Part 2: Representation Control

**Representation Control** (also called **Representation Steering**) involves modifying the activations of the LLM during a forward pass to influence its behavior. This section explores ways to control the internal representations of concepts and functions within the model.

#### Step 1: Choose a Controller

There are several options for selecting a controller:

- **Reading Vector**: The vector extracted from the Representation Reading process.
- **Contrast Vector**: Derived from a pair of contrastive prompts during inference. The difference between the representations of these prompts forms a Contrast Vector.
- **Low-Rank Adapter**: Fine-tune low-rank adapters linked to the model, applying a specific loss function to representations.

#### Step 2: Choose an Intervention Method

After selecting a controller, choose an operator to apply to the model’s inner activations:

- **Linear Combination**: Blend vectors linearly to steer activations.
- **Piece-Wise Operation**: Apply different transformations to parts of the vector.
- **Projection**: Project onto or away from certain concept directions.
- **Adapter**: Use fine-tuned adapters to influence representations based on the desired concept or function.

This blog post provides an overview of **Representation Engineering** as a structured approach to understanding and guiding LLM behaviors. By working within representational spaces rather than specific neurons or pathways, RepE opens new possibilities for transparent and controllable AI.
